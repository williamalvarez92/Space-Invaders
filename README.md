# 👾 Space Invaders 👾

This is my first solo project.

I have played it when I was a kid many times, it is a an icon for an aspiring software engineer.

It terms of difficulty it feels more or less as difficult, but at the same time I have the feeling I will learn so much from it.

6) Functions:

- Alien movement: They will need to be moving, from left to right, with a interval (can conf here to make it more difficult the further they go). Until they reach the goal cells in the bottom and the the game checker will activate.
- Red shooting function: every time we press space, a laser will come out from the ship up. If it hits an alien then checker activates.
- Blue shooting function: Randomly shoots from alien, and goes down. If it hits ship then checker activates.
